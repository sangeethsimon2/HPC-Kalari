Toy experiments to explore designing, implementing, performance analysis and tuning of 
various types of scientific computing applications  for modern heterogeneous computing 
platforms using various parallel libraries specifically targeting intra-node and Inter-node 
computing resources. Focus is given to the following software components:

C++ designs, clean and readable code, 
MPI inter-node/intra-node communications, 
Accelerator offloading using OPENACC/CUDA,
Unit & integration testing
